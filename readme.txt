== Installation ==

#### Minimum System Requirements

+ A solid understanding that this is a real plugin
+ PHP 7.2 is life but it'll probably work on 5.6 (or even 5.3 if you're really into living in the past).
+ MariaDB. Who knows what MySQL even is anymore, am I right?
+ WordPress 4.9.5 or later because I'm seriously not going to boot up an old version or look through the codex for minimum support here.

#### Installation Instructions

1. Post your email address to the support forums here with the topic "Installation Assistance"
2. Wait 3 - 48 weeks and you'll receive an email with the subject line "[One Thousand Nine Hundred and Ninety-Nineify] Teh Next Steps"
3. In this email you'll find a link to a Google Map
4. Sometime in the next 2 - 6 weeks travel to this location. Plan to arrive between 9am - 5pm.
5. When you arrive there will be a dog in the front yard running back and forth and barking like crazy. Don't worry she's actually pretty nice when you get to know her (but you won't get to know her).
6. Don't leave. After a few minutes a man will hear the dog and come outside squinting. He'll be wearing sweat pants or basketball shorts and he may be wearing a shirt. He'll say "BOOTY! That's ENOUGH!"
7. The dog will look at him and then look at you and then bark a bit more before she turns away and enters the house.
8. The man will say "Sorry about her. Can I help you?"
9. You should reply "I would like to install One Thousand Nine Hundred and Ninety-Nineify on my WordPress website"
10. He'll nod and ask you to wait a minute. Stay on the sidewalk. You can lean against the fence if you want. Do not enter the yard.
11. After a few minutes he'll return and hand you a USB stick.
12. You should thank him but you don't have to.
13. Return to your computer.
15. Plug the USB stick into a USB drive.
16. Open the 'README.txt' file
17. Follow the instructions contained therein to continue the installation process
